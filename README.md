# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
The "Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning" project is designed to predict individual medical insurance costs based on various demographic and health-related factors. Using data-driven insights, this project aims to assist healthcare providers, insurance companies, and individuals in understanding and forecasting medical expenses.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 2,772 entries with 7 features:
- `age`: Age of the primary beneficiary.
- `sex`: Gender of the primary beneficiary.
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index, which provides a sense of an individual's body weight adjusted for height.
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
- `smoker`: Smoking status of the beneficiary.
- `region`: The beneficiaryâ€™s residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- `charges`: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulvyasm/medical-insurance-cost-prediction.git
cd medical-insurance-cost-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the scripts in this project:
1. Navigate to the cloned directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook for an interactive session:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 95-medical-insurance-price-prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. To execute a Python script directly:
   ```bash
   python medical_insurance_price_predictor.py
   ```

## Features
- Comprehensive data analysis and visualization of insurance costs and factors.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models to predict insurance costs.
- Evaluation of model performance to ensure accuracy and reliability.
